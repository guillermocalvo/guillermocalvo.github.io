        layers for banking corporations and major e-commerce platforms, focusing on data flow streamlining and system
        integrations. This laid essential groundwork for understanding complex business processes and system
        interdependencies at scale.
      - **Diverse technical exposure**: Engaged in a variety of projects, from developing for microdevices to exploring
        Ambient Intelligence and Semantic Web technologies. This breadth of experience highlights a consistent drive for
        learning and applying new technologies to solve diverse challenges.
      - **Early Open-Source and innovation**: My participation in projects like
        [exceptions4c](https://guillermo.dev/exceptions4c/) and game development, even if in different languages,
        demonstrates an early proactive approach to innovation, problem-solving, and community contribution.
