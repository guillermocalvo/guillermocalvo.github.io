      This **Open Source** library can help boost performance of Java
      applications by avoiding exception overhead.


      `Result` objects represent the outcome of an operation, removing the need
      to both `catch` exceptions and check for `null`. Operations that
      succeed produce results encapsulating a *success* value; operations that
      fail produce results with a *failure* value.


      Strong evidence suggests that results outperform exceptions. According to
      the
      [latest benchmarks](https://dev.leakyabstractions.com/result-benchmark/),
      throwing an exception is several orders of magnitude slower than returning
      a failed result.

      If you're ready to tap into the power of results, you can read the guide
      and transform your error handling today.

      This was my first published game for *Android*. It's an educational memory
      game to learn Hiragana and Katakana (syllabic Japanese scripts). It's
      **open source** and made with with

      A **C library for error handling** through exceptions. Among other
      functionalities, it lets the developer handle error signals sent by the
      operative system to the program (such as *division by zero*). It is
      portable and supports multi-threading.
